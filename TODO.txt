* Implement missing arithmetic operations.

* Implement missing comparisons.

* Implement creation of arrays from objects supporting the buffer protocol.

* 0-d arrays should not be sequences.  Currently there are problems with using
  0-d arrays with PySequence_Fast.

* Consider reducing the amount of templated code by having more dtype-flexible
  code.
