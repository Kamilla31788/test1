* Fix float hash on 32 bit machines

* Fix this: ta.array(np.matrix([1,2,3]))

* Implement missing arithmetic operations.

* Implement missing comparisons.

* Implement creation of arrays from objects supporting the buffer protocol.

* 0-d arrays should not be sequences.  Currently there are problems with using
  0-d arrays with PySequence_Fast.

* Consider reducing the amount of templated code by having more dtype-flexible
  code.

* Optimize readin_arraylike for elements that are tinyarrays

* Implement concatenate
