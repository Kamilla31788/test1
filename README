Tinyarray
=========

Tinyarray is an numerical array package for Python.  It implements a basic
subset of NumPy's functionality in a way optimized for small arrays, both in
terms memory usage of runtime.  For small arrays, speedups of 3 to 35 times are
measured compared to NumPy.  Unlike NumPy arrays, tinyarrays are immutable and
thus can be used as dictionary keys.
